I was originally planning on using datetime() objects to indicate the time
parameters of tasks, but now I think that a better way to go is to use blocks of
time, probably 15 minute blocks. I think this will make task splitting (across
days, or during pauses) much easier.

So a 1.5 hour task will have a value of 6, and a 3 day task (assuming 8 hour
days) will have a value of 96. (4*8*3). 

-------------------
There is a difference between predicted timeline and actual timeline. Tasks get
juggled, put on hold, reprioritized. When you change your order of work, this
should be reflected in the project layout.

------------------------
Also going to want a "Resource" based view, to look at time assignments per
resource. This would help in understanding what kind of capacity is still being
untapped.

Now I need to create a time allocation system, much like memory allocation, so
that resources can be shared across projects.

I also need to add grouping to the DOT view, so that resources get all their
tasks grouped together. And need to add both solid and dotted lines representing
hard and soft allocations, respectively. A soft line between tasks would be
connecting them because the resource would be working on one then the other, due
to task priority and time. A hard line would be because one is defined as a
prereq of the other.
